### CPSC 120

* Lab 5
    Lab 5 stands out as a pivotal experience, a foundational building block where I gained confidence in programming. It marked my transition into a more adept coder, even though the learning curve was a bit long. Overall, it became a favorite as I felt a solid grasp of the material. Specifically, we delved into how functions calculate the area of a rectangle based on length and width, ensuring that the function adheres to the specified prototype and returns the correct result.
* Lab 6
   Lab 6 became my choice due to its challenging nature, testing my newfound logic. I encountered difficulties, prompting numerous questions. Answers didn't come easily, but this struggle enhanced my experience. While experiences may vary, the critical thinking demanded in the lab significantly improved my overall learning journey. In this lab, we not only learned how to validate inputs but also mastered the art of handling multiple arguments, adding depth to our problem-solving skills.
* Lab 7
    Lab 7 was a significant stride in my learning journey. Completing it felt relatively easy, showcasing my improved understanding of the material. The shorter duration to finish indicated a growing mastery, and successfully accomplishing the lab tasks was a proud moment, affirming my grasp of the taught concepts. In this lab, our focus was on how to accurately format calculations, and we honed our skills in performing multiple calculations with precision.
