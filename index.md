### CPSC 120

* Lab 5
    Lab 5 stands out as a pivotal experience, a foundational building block where I gained confidence in programming. It marked my transition into a more adept coder, even though the learning curve was a bit long. Overall, it became a favorite as I felt a solid grasp of the material.
* Lab 6
    Lab 6 became my choice due to its challenging nature, testing my newfound logic. I encountered difficulties, prompting numerous questions. Answers didn't come easily, but this struggle enhanced my experience. While experiences may vary, the critical thinking demanded in the lab significantly improved my overall learning journey.
* Lab 7
    Lab 7 was a significant stride in my learning journey. Completing it felt relatively easy, showcasing my improved understanding of the material. The shorter duration to finish indicated a growing mastery, and successfully accomplishing the lab tasks was a proud moment, affirming my grasp of the taught concepts.
